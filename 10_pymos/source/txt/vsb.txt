In the **Shichman-Hodges MOSFET model (SHM)**, `Vsb` stands for the **source-to-bulk voltage** 
(also called source-to-substrate voltage).

* `Vsb = V_source - V_bulk`
* It is the **voltage difference between the source and the body (substrate)** of the MOSFET.

### Why `Vsb` matters:

`Vsb` plays a key role in modeling the **body effect** (also called the back-gate effect), 
which affects the threshold voltage `Vth`. In short:

**As `Vsb` increases (i.e., body more negative for NMOS), the threshold voltage increases.**

This is captured in the SHM by the body effect equation:

Vth = VTO + GAMMA * (sqrt(abs(Vsb + 2*PHI)) - sqrt(abs(2*PHI)))

Where:

* VT0   = zero-bias threshold voltage
* gamma = body effect coefficient
* phi   = surface potential (\~0.3â€“0.4 V for silicon at room temp)
* vsb   = source-to-bulk voltage

### NMOS vs PMOS:

| Type | `Vsb` Positive When... | Body Connection Typically |
| ---- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| NMOS | Source is above bulk   | Bulk tied to GND          |
| PMOS | Source is below bulk   | Bulk tied to VDD          |


* `Vsb` affects the **threshold voltage** via the body effect.
* It must be correctly set based on the source and bulk voltages to get accurate modeling of `I_D`.
